# Silver-telegram

The program exposes an HTTP interface with two endpoints:

1. `POST /learn` expecting a body of text, sent as the POST body with `Content-Type: text/plain`.
2. `GET /generate` returns randomly-generated text based on all the trigrams that have been learned since starting the program.

Note: to chnage the complexity of what is returned in the second endpoint, a query of complexity=10 can be added

```
$ curl --data-binary @pride-prejudice.txt localhost:8080/learn
$ curl localhost:8080/generate
```
